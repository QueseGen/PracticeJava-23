# PRACTICEJAVA-23

The Goal of PRACTICEJAVA-23 to to take all of the Practice code I can find on my pc and move to convert to .java and organized.

## Scripts
 Made a helpful bash [script](https://github.com/QueseGen/PracticeJava-23/blob/main/src/main/examples/Advanced/scripts/change_extension.sh) that converts .class files to .java files

```bash
 ./src/main/examples/Advanced/scripts/change_extension.sh
```
